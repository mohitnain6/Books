car selecting app , web 
idea behind is customer doesn't know the pros, and cons 
my app try to find a car thats suit to there own budget the specification they need 
engine specification that in india no one talk about what is under the hood 
tyre size 
means that a hole guide to lead a customer toward the car they want about the comfort 
because dealers never tell them a truth 
and the benifit from this is when customer go to buy a car he/she know whats he / she buying with each and every detail
its like when customer buy a energy drink if he/she reads only the title and front side he/she will impress buy there marketing stretgy
but the truth behind every drink is its ingridents almost every energy drink is contain 40-60% sugar some flavours there is nothing and rest
is caffine, every energy drink in market is all about sugar flavour and caffine but still customers are buying them. 
the my main idea behind is customer should know what they buying no one can fool them
